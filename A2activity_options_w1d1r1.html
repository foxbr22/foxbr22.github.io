        <div class="story">
            <p>Last weekend, I took my daughter to the park. She brought her favorite bag with her. It was a sunny day, and we enjoyed walking and talking. She told me about her school and friends, and we had a lovely time together.</p>
            <p>While we were sitting on a bench, a boy came by with his own bag. He showed us his toys inside and said proudly, "These toys are mine." My daughter smiled and showed him her bag, saying, "This bag is mine, and it has my favorite things in it." They started playing and sharing their toys, laughing and having fun.</p>
            <p>When it was time to leave, my daughter asked, "Whose bag is that on the bench?" I looked and saw it was hers. I said, "That bag is yours, my dear. Don't forget to take it with you." She grabbed her bag and hugged it tightly, saying, "This bag is definitely mine." She was so happy to have it with her as we walked back home, talking about the fun day we had.</p>
