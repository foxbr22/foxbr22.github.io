        </ul>

        <h2>5. Questions</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>"Is she happy?"</li>
            <li>"Are you a student?"</li>
            <li>"Is it raining?"</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Negative Form</h2>

            <li>"I am not tired."</li>
            <li>"She is not here."</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. Contractions</h2>
        <p>Contractions are common in spoken English and informal writing. Here are the rules for using contractions with 'be':</p>

        <h3>Common Contractions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm (I am), you're (you are), he's (he is), she's (she is), it's (it is), we're (we are), they're (they are)</li>
            <li>isn't (is not), aren't (are not), wasn't (was not), weren't (were not)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Rules for Using Contractions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Using more than one contraction is not allowed:
                <ul>
                    <li>Correct: "She's not ready."</li>
                    <li>Incorrect: ~~"She'sn't ready."~~</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Affirmative contractions are not used at the end of clauses:
                <div class="dialogue">
                    <strong>A:</strong> "I think they're late."<br>
                    <strong>B:</strong> "Yes, I think they are." (Not: ~~"I think they're."~~)
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>Negative contractions can be used at the end of clauses:
                <div class="dialogue">
                    <strong>A:</strong> "Is the meeting still on for today?"<br>
                    <strong>B:</strong> "No, it isn't."
                </div>
            </li>
            <li>Contractions are commonly used in tag questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>"He's the new manager, isn't he?"</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In question forms, 'am not' is contracted to 'aren't':
                <ul>
                    <li>Correct: "I'm doing well in this class, aren't I?"</li>
                    <li>Incorrect: ~~"I'm doing well in this class, amn't I?"~~</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Example Conversation</h2>
        <div class="dialogue">
            <strong>A:</strong> "Are you ready for the presentation?"<br>
            <strong>B:</strong> "No, I'm not quite ready yet. I'm still reviewing my notes."<br>
            <strong>A:</strong> "Oh, I see. You're presenting first, aren't you?"<br>
            <strong>B:</strong> "Yes, I am. I'm a bit nervous."
