        <h1>Phrasal Verbs</h1>

        <h2>What are Phrasal Verbs?</h2>
        <p>Phrasal verbs are combinations of words that are used like a single verb. They consist of a verb and one or two particles (usually prepositions or adverbs). The meaning of a phrasal verb is often different from the meanings of its individual words.</p>

        <h2>Common Uses</h2>
        <p>Phrasal verbs are very common in everyday English, especially in informal speech and writing. They are used to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Express actions</li>
            <li>Describe situations</li>
            <li>Replace more formal single-word verbs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <div class="example">
            <h3>1. Break up</h3>
            <p><strong>Common meaning:</strong> To end a relationship</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sarah and Tom broke up after dating for two years.</p>
            <p><strong>Additional meaning:</strong> To have problems with video or audio signal</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> The video call is breaking up due to poor internet connection.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>2. Turn up</h3>
            <p><strong>Common meaning:</strong> To arrive, especially unexpectedly</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> My old friend turned up at the party last night.</p>
            <p><strong>Additional meaning:</strong> To increase volume</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Can you turn up the volume? I can't hear the TV.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example">
            <h3>3. Call back</h3>
            <p><strong>Meaning:</strong> To return a phone call</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> I'll call you back as soon as I finish this meeting.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Remember, the meaning of a phrasal verb often cannot be guessed from its parts. It's best to learn them in context and practice using them in sentences.</p>
